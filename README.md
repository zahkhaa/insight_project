# YOUR-TO airbnb

Airbnb is widely used by many people visitng Toronto and looking for temporary accomobodation. Yet, other than having the choice of location, house type (shared, private etc), Airbnb does not allow to filter through listings using personal preferences. Users
have to browse through the description of each listing to see the details and figure out if it suits their needs. e.g. clean, close to subway, grocery etc. For many users, these preferences are an essestial requirement. Thus, users end up spending considerable amount of time on their search with no guarantee that their chosen listing is the best one among similar listings.
